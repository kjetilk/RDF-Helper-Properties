NAME
    RDF::Helper::Properties - Module that provides shortcuts to retrieve
    certain information

VERSION
    Version 0.22

SYNOPSIS
     my $helper = RDF::Helper::Properties->new($model);
     print $helper->title($node);

DESCRIPTION
  Constructor
    "new(model => $model, %attributes)"
        Moose-style constructor.

  Attributes
    "model"
        The RDF::Trine::Model which data will be extracted from. The only
        attribute which the constructor requires.

    "page_properties"
        An arrayref of RDF::Trine::Node::Resource objects, each of which are
        taken to mean "something a bit like foaf:homepage". There is a
        sensible default.

    "title_properties"
        An arrayref of RDF::Trine::Node::Resource objects, each of which are
        taken to mean "something a bit like foaf:name". There is a sensible
        default.

    "cache"
        A hashref for caching data into, or a blessed object which supports
        "get" and "set" methods compatible with CHI and Cache::Cache. If you
        do not supply a cache, then a hashref will be used by default.

  Methods
    "page($node)"
        A suitable page to redirect to, based on foaf:page or foaf:homepage.

    "title($node)"
        A suitable title for the document will be returned, based on
        document contents.

        Called in list context, returns a ($value, $lang, $datatype) tuple.

    "description($node)"
        A suitable description for the document will be returned, based on
        document contents

    "html_node_value($node)"
        Formats the nodes for HTML output.
